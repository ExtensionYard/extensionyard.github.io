            <p>
                At Extension Yard, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, 
                use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Chrome browser extensions. Please

            <p>
                We want to be transparent about what we do NOT collect:

            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our extensions</li>

            <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>
                We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information against 
                unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission 
                over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of our extensions store data locally on your device. Any data stored locally remains on 
                your device and is not transmitted to our servers unless explicitly required for extension 
                functionality.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                Our extensions may integrate with third-party services (such as APIs or analytics services) to 
                provide functionality. These third-party services have their own privacy policies governing the 
                collection and use of your information. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may use the following types of third-party services:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Analytics Services:</strong> To understand how our extensions are used and to 
                improve them (data is typically anonymized)</li>
                <li><strong>Hosting Services:</strong> To host our website and related services</li>

                is used for:

                the extension's Chrome Web Store listing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

                processes</li>
                <li><strong>Protection of Rights:</strong> To protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, 
                or that of our users</li>

                us in operating our services, subject to confidentiality agreements</li>
